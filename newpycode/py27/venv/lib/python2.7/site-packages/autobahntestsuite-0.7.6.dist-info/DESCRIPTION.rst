Twisted-based WebSocket/WAMP protocol implementation test suite.

Autobahn|Testsuite provides a fully automated test suite to verify client and
server implementations of the WebSocket protocol.

The test suite will check an implementation by doing basic WebSocket
conversations, extensive protocol compliance verification and
performance and limits testing.

Contains over 500 test cases covering

* Framing
* Pings/Pongs
* Reserved Bits
* Opcodes
* Fragmentation
* UTF-8 Handling
* Limits/Performance
* Closing Handshake
* Opening Handshake (under development)
* WebSocket compression (permessage-deflate extension)

Besides the automated test suite, wstest also includes a number
of other handy developer tools:

* WebSocket echo server and client
* WebSocket broadcast server (and client driver)
* Testee modes to test Autobahn itself against the test suite
* wsperf controller and master (see http://www.zaphoyd.com/wsperf)
* WAMP server and client, for developing WAMP implementations
